							<p> I built my first website in 2013. It was through squarespace, but it worked for my friends business needs. He was a contractor in
								need of a place to funnel customer interactions and quote requests. A mututal friend saw it, liked it, and asked for a build
								of their own. This was for their law practice. The next one was for an event company. I spent a few years continuing
								to take on clients, while pursing live event videography and holding a full time job as a Project Manager in the construction Industry. 
								When the pandemic hit, that avenue dried up, and I had to find a way to keep the train rolling. I was able to pivot to taking on more web 
								development clients, and doubled down on building full stack applications custom tailored to my clients' needs.
							</p>													
							<p> With the rapid changes in technology available today, every business needs a web presence. Having something available for customers 
								will help you control how your business interacts with customers, and helps you control the flow of communication. Even if your presence 
								is 'basic', any presence is better than no presence in todays climate. I offer a wide range of services for your business and personal 
								portfolio needs, and welcome the chance to brainstorm with you. Let me help you get your project off the ground, get in touch today!
